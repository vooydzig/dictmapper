dictmapper
=
Data mapper from one deserialized json object to another.

The "Why"
--
Let's say You have two APIs that both consume and produce data as JSON.
One returns data in schema A, and You want to transform this data and push it onto another API with schema B.

Here comes `dictmapper`! 

Using dict mapper You can create quick and simple mappings from one schema to another using JSONPath syntax.

The "How"
--  

Check `tests.py` for full list of examples and supported operations. Below is quick example:

```python
from mapper import JSONMapper, Mapping
#assume the following returns valid JSON data
# for example returns {"foo": 1}
source = json.loads(FirstApi.get_data_from_endpoint(endpoint)) 

m = JSONMapper(mapping=[Mapping(source='foo', destination='bar', transform=None)])

#assume the following consumes valid JSON data
# for example consumes {'bar': [number]}
SecondApi.post_data_to_endpoint(endpoint2, json.dumps(m.map(source_data)))
```
 
If anything goes wrong feel free to submit a ticket.

The dependency
--
`dictmapper` uses `jsonpath_rw` to parse JSONPaths. Check it out here: https://github.com/kennknowles/python-jsonpath-rw
